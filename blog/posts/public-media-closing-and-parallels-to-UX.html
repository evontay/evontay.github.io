                <h2>When Sapiens closes…</h2>
<p>I found out recently that Sapiens, my favourite anthropology magazine, is closing down, and I didn&#39;t expect it to hit me as hard as it did. This was where I went when the world felt confusing and fast, when I needed help slowing down to make sense of it through the lens of culture, history, and lived experience. It managed to be thoughtful without being distant, critical without being cynical, and it reminded me why anthropology mattered beyond the academy.</p>
<p>My first reaction was sadness, then curiosity about why this publication, why now. As I read more about the reasons (funding constraints, shifting institutional priorities, the difficulty of sustaining public-facing scholarship), it started to feel less like an isolated event and more like a pattern I&#39;d been noticing elsewhere.</p>
<h2>What gets funded, what gets flattened</h2>
<p>Across academia, media, and tech, money increasingly flows toward things that scale cleanly: platforms, tools, measurable outputs. What struggles to survive are the in-between forms of work like translation, interpretation, and sensemaking, especially when their impact is slow and hard to quantify. Public anthropology sits squarely in that uncomfortable middle, being neither &quot;pure research&quot; nor a product, requiring time and editorial care in systems that prefer speed and demonstrable ROI.</p>
<p>And yet anthropology hasn&#39;t disappeared at all. I see it everywhere, just showing up under different names like &quot;human context,&quot; &quot;systems thinking,&quot; or &quot;organisational culture.&quot; People encounter anthropological thinking constantly, even when they don&#39;t recognise it as such.</p>
<p>That realisation gave me a strong sense of déjà vu. In design practice, I&#39;ve watched information architecture and service design get folded under the broad umbrella of &quot;UX&quot; in a consolidation that helped the field gain legitimacy but also flattened important distinctions. Over time, some practices became invisible, expected, and under-resourced. The work survived. The recognition didn&#39;t.</p>
<h2>The question I can&#39;t shake</h2>
<p>I keep wondering what it means when we rely on forms of understanding that we&#39;re simultaneously unwilling to sustain. In design organisations I&#39;ve observed, the slow interpretive work that makes human-centred practice meaningful (ethnographic research, systems mapping, ongoing sensemaking) rarely survives when budgets tighten. It&#39;s treated as &quot;nice to have&quot; right up until its absence creates expensive problems.</p>
<p>The pattern with Sapiens feels uncomfortably similar. AI development seems to be accelerating it, with demand for &quot;human understanding&quot; exploding while what actually gets funded are models and platforms. The slow interpretive labour behind them gets treated as background work.</p>
<p>Maybe Sapiens didn&#39;t fail so much as the systems around it did. We talk constantly about being &quot;human-centred&quot; in design and AI (I&#39;ve used those words myself), but repeatedly the infrastructures that actually support this kind of thinking are the first to be absorbed or quietly removed when resources get tight.</p>
<p>The work will survive because it always does. People will keep trying to understand culture and context because that understanding matters. But here&#39;s what makes me hopeful about where this might be heading.</p>
<p>UX&#39;s trajectory suggests a path forward. Twenty years ago, &quot;user experience&quot; was a fringe concern, whereas today even organisations that practice it poorly understand they need it. What changed wasn&#39;t just awareness but infrastructure: design systems, operations roles, embedded practitioners, and leadership positions with budget authority.</p>
<p>Anthropology might follow a similar arc. I&#39;m already seeing signs of it in researchers embedded in tech companies studying algorithmic impact, organisational anthropologists helping companies navigate change, and practitioners bringing ethnographic methods into policy work. Much of this is happening outside traditional academic structures. What&#39;s missing isn&#39;t demand but the institutional scaffolding: publications like Sapiens, dedicated roles that aren&#39;t just &quot;UX researchers who also do ethnography,&quot; and funding models that treat interpretive work as infrastructure rather than overhead.</p>
<p>UX didn&#39;t become essential because designers made better arguments. It became essential because organisations kept shipping products that frustrated users until eventually the cost of ignoring human understanding exceeded the cost of investing in it. Maybe that&#39;s what&#39;s happening with anthropology now, as AI systems shape more of daily life, as organisations struggle to navigate cultural complexity, and as we recognise that technical solutions without cultural understanding create new problems. The cost of not having this infrastructure becomes harder to ignore.</p>
<p>Sapiens closing feels like a loss. But perhaps it&#39;s also a transition point, the moment before anthropological thinking gets the structural support it needs, because the alternative has become too expensive.</p>
