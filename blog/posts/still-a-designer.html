            <div class="content"><p>I&#39;m still a designer. I just design human systems instead of software systems now.</p>
<p>It took me a while to notice this. I wasn&#39;t resisting DesignOps or thinking I had to leave design behind…I was just doing the work. But at some point I realized I was unconsciously shaping my DesignOps practice by drawing from my design practice. Same thinking, different canvas.</p>
<p><strong>How it started</strong></p>
<p>It began with small things: creating standardized research templates, sharing reusable UI components on Sketch (Figma wasn&#39;t a thing yet), organizing meetups with other UX teams to exchange knowledge.</p>
<p>I wasn&#39;t trying to build a career in DesignOps. I was just noticing friction and trying to reduce it.</p>
<p><strong>The turning point</strong></p>
<p>When the three regions merged, I realized no one was coordinating the change for everyone. My manager asked me to form a small working group to tackle immediate problems—demand, intake, the operational stuff. That trust mattered, and so did having people to problem-solve with.</p>
<p>We started with the concrete issues, but quickly realized the harder problems were the unspoken human ones: different working styles, communication norms, expectations no one had named. The technical consolidation was straightforward, but the cultural integration required a completely different approach.</p>
<p>We ended up using anthropological methods instead of design sprints—the same human-centered thinking we all knew, just applied to organizational dynamics. The data was messier and the feedback loops were slower, but it was still fundamentally design work.</p>
<p><strong>What I noticed</strong></p>
<p>I was approaching DesignOps the same way I approached design: solving for human needs, iterating toward better solutions, making the invisible visible. Just with others and at a different scale.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s what leadership looks like for me: not managing people, but designing the conditions for people to do their best work.</p>
<p><strong>What actually shifted</strong></p>
<p>My scope expanded, but my identity didn&#39;t. We design conditions instead of solutions now, systems instead of interfaces, infrastructure instead of features. It&#39;s more ambiguous and harder to measure, but the approach stayed constant: observe, understand, design for real needs, iterate.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re making this transition, know that it starts smaller than you think. You need sponsorship, trust from your manager, and people to problem-solve with. And you&#39;re not leaving design behind—you&#39;re discovering what else can be designed when circumstances align.</p>
