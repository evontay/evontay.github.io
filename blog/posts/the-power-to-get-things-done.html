                <p>Picture this. You’re invited to an alignment meeting with a room full of tech leads and PMs from various squads for the first time. The person hosting the meeting has opened up the Jira board on shared screen, calling up each person on the call one by one and asking them to follow up on their tickets on the board. Her voice was commanding and assertive. She takes no bullshit answers. She will follow up with questions until clarity is achieved for each issue. </p>
<p>I have hosted my fair share of meetings, but I’ve never tried this way of doing it. But I can’t help admiring how she did it. </p>
<p>Granted, she is of higher ranking than most in the room. But it is not her job position but how she carried herself that made her effective <em>(and perhaps feared… sometimes fear is the most effective motivation.)</em></p>
<p>I’ve been reflecting on the power of presence. Sure, its not just what you say, but how you say it, your body language and your tone of voice, that changes how people perceive you and how cooperative they can choose to be with you.</p>
