<p>In agile, we’re always talking about MVP. Minimal viable product. And we have all kinds of different interpretation of what this concept of MVP is really about. And expectations about it. So this is my first one. </p>
<h3>Expectation #1: “Let’s do an MVP…”</h3>
<p><strong>Product manager’s expectations:</strong> <em>“Let’s ship this feature quickly, we can always improve it later.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reality</strong> - Later never came. Team being pressured by business to build next feature before funding runs out.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>UX’s expectations:</strong> <em>“UX research will help us find the right problem to solve.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reality</strong> - no time for discovery.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stakeholder’s expectations:</strong> <em>“I’m given this much budget to build an MVP app. I want as many feature as possible, since I don’t know when the next round of funding might come.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reality</strong> - All features are at MVP state - complicated to use, doesn’t solve user problems. Poor usage, no value = no more funding</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 ### <strong>Recommendation: Be clear what your MVP is for</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prioritise for learning about user outcomes, not just the feature delivered. Ask ourselves, <em>what is the minimum thing to build to learn the next most important thing?</em>  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Also, w_hat is something we can learn first, before even building anything?_  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Usually when stakeholders insist on building the solution first before doing any real user research, they are thinking short-term outputs.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Manage their expectations but helping them see the importance of outcomes for business, because usually the <em>desire for a quick MVP is a symptom, that we don&#39;t have the user research that we need to know what to build, that</em> <em><strong>meet minimum threshold of quality -</strong></em> <em>the right thing to build that meets users expectations.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>### **Recommendation: Be clear what your MVP is for**

- Prioritise for learning about user outcomes, not just the feature delivered. Ask ourselves, _what is the minimum thing to build to learn the next most important thing?_
- Also, w_hat is something we can learn first, before even building anything?_
- Usually when stakeholders insist on building the solution first before doing any real user research, they are thinking short-term outputs.

<hr>
<p>Here’s another situation some of you might find familiar with….</p>
<h3><strong>Expectation #2:</strong> <em><strong>“Let’s use something easily available to us as a product metric.”</strong></em></h3>
<p>It might look something like this…</p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> <em>“Putting GA track on every single even so we won’t miss anything.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reality</strong> - GA is a great tool if you know how to use it effectively. But if you’re putting everything on a dashboard, cutting with numbers that doesn’t tell the team anything actionable or if you’re getting close to your goals</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>UX:</strong> <em>“Metrics is a PM’s job. I just have to do my research and design the features.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reality</strong> - When UX people ignore metrics, you’ll have no measurement of success. Which makes it hard to justify the ROI and value of UX. How would you know if you’re doing a good job?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stakeholders:</strong> _<strong>“</strong>_<em>I need some tangible figures to show my product is successful”</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reality</strong> - You get the highest rudimentary figure to show success to upper management, but no indicated is product is really providing value to end customer.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 ### Recommendations: Make your metrics more human-centred related than just number.  </p>
<p>If you have done your discovery right, you’d know what are the problems you need to solve to make your user’s life better.  </p>
<p>The best way to do that is to talk to them. Do quick user testing or simply chat with your users. Get your whole team involved, and expose them to talking to users. When everyone in the team understands the users and their problems, we can build a better product for them. And when the whole team knows what is the problem we’re solving for users, that becomes our Definition of Done.  </p>
<p>Beware of popular metrics like Net Promoter Score, System Usability Score etc. Or any type of standardised scoring. They give you a number but doesn’t tell you the value of your product for the users. Say if your product is scoring 7 last release, and 6 in the release. What does it tell you that you can act on? Your time is better spent engaging with users, doing qualitative research to find out the real actionable insights.</p>

<p>Here’s another scenario… How many times have you heard, </p>
<h3>Expectation #3: <em>“We don’t have time to do user research”</em></h3>
<p><strong>UX Research becomes a bottleneck</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In our department, we have about 1 researcher to 52 employees. We call this in the industry “Peanut Buttering”.</li>
<li>Teams are fighting for a UX resource allocation because they think without a UX person they won’t be able to do UX. And if you’re one of the lucky teams that could get allocation for a UX member on your product team, the expectation might be this UX person will be able to do all the research you need.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PM says,</strong> <em>“This is why we want to have a UX person allocated o us. They will help us do all the research needed.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reality:</strong> When UX is being done by 1 team member, it becomes a bottleneck. Team will be pressured by stakeholder to start building quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>UX says,</strong> <em>“There’s so much to be done, am I slowing everyone down? Maybe I should start designing some screens for them to build first.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reality:</strong> What product lacks in research is made up by heavy up-front design work. Designer creates screens based on guesses which leads to UX/tech debt and rework later on.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stakeholder says,</strong> <em>“I already know what I want, research is just taking time away from my features getting built.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reality:</strong> Teams that build products according to requirements but without user research and validation are likely to build something feature-reach but nobody wants to use.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 ### <strong>Recommendations – Get the whole team to be involved in discovery</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Whether you’re aware or not, every decision the engineers in your team makes has an impact on the end-user experience. This means, they are actually designing the UX. And it is terrifying when you’re trying to make informed decisions in your product.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>So everyone is a designer. But not everyone is a great designer. But everyone can learn to be a better one, and make more informed decisions that impact the users.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>You know what is the true value of having a UX member in your team? They can guide your team to do better UX. Don’t make them do it themselves, going off on their own, creating a bunch of one-off deliverables that nobody reads after 2 weeks. We’re trying to produce better outcomes together, not just outputs.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Infuse the culture of doing user interviews, testing, design reviews, continuous discovery together. Always be talking to users even if you’re not building.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>### **Recommendations – Get the whole team to be involved in discovery**

- Whether you’re aware or not, every decision the engineers in your team makes has an impact on the end-user experience. This means, they are actually designing the UX. And it is terrifying when you’re trying to make informed decisions in your product.
- So everyone is a designer. But not everyone is a great designer. But everyone can learn to be a better one, and make more informed decisions that impact the users.

<h3>Problem: <em>“What if we don’t have the budget to do discovery and continuous learning?”</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>Common situation for internal projects: funding only comes in for 3-6 months, before the team is ushered off to work on the next project.</li>
<li>This situation is a systemic problem, so the only way to combat it is to take a proactive approach.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 ### Recommendation: Proactive Transformation  </p>
<p>There are 2 things we as product delivery teams can do:  </p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Plan for the long term while make do what you can for the right now.</strong> - in this case, set up your analytics first and let it run. If you’re really passionate about this project, cross your fingers for the one day the tap turns back on again for you to continue where you left off.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>But while you’re doing that , the other more important thing to do is to <strong>be proactive about making change</strong>, challenge the system to do better. We all have to do our part to transform our company and its status quo. This is what the IT transformation is all about.</p>

</ol>
<p>Let your managers and leaders know the value of user centered discovery and continuous learning. And let them know the cost to our bottomline if we don’t do something to tackle this issue together.</p>

<pre><code>### Recommendation: Proactive Transformation


There are 2 things we as product delivery teams can do:

1. **Plan for the long term while make do what you can for the right now.** - in this case, set up your analytics first and let it run. If you’re really passionate about this project, cross your fingers for the one day the tap turns back on again for you to continue where you left off.
2. But while you’re doing that , the other more important thing to do is to **be proactive about making change**, challenge the system to do better. We all have to do our part to transform our company and its status quo. This is what the IT transformation is all about.

Let your managers and leaders know the value of user centered discovery and continuous learning. And let them know the cost to our bottomline if we don’t do something to tackle this issue together.
</code></pre>
<h3><strong>Can we become a human-centred, outcome focused, learning organisation?</strong></h3>
<p>Here’s a summary of key takeaways I want you to have.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Build the right MVP with user research.</strong></li>
<li><strong>More human-centred metrics: User-centric outcomes and the milestones to get there.</strong></li>
<li><strong>UX discovery is too important to be done by only 1 person on the team.</strong></li>
</ol>
